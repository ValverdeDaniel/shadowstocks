can you help me build an upwork job description and some screening questions
















job description
I want to build a data aggregation tool for US stock and options analysis. I would like to build tree pandas dataframes and aggregate the following data for multiple stocks in a dataframe no database necessary just running this script on my command and storing in a csv or excel format similar to the way below all code should be ideally written in Python:

table 1
columns: 
stock ticker,
current price, 
all time high - all time price within the last 5 years,
recent high - highest price in the last 6 months,
earnings date- next earnings date
current pe - price/earnings 
fair value avg current year - (average annual p/e last 5 years) * diluted eps current year
fair value avg next year - (average annual p/e last 5 years) * diluted eps next year



specific data points interested in knowing how they will be acquired table 1:
historical earnings 5 years back adjusted for stock splits
historical pe 5 years back adjusted for stock splits
diluted eps next year
diluted eps current year

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

table 2
eps trend
columns [current quarter, next quarter, current year, next year]
rows [7 days ago, 30 days ago, 60 days ago, 90 days ago]


----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

table 3 columns:
stock ticker
option type - (call/put)
earnings date- date of next earnings call
strike price - strike price of contract
option expiration date - date of expiration of the contract specified
current contract price - current contract price
+5% stock move in 60 days- the value displayed should be what the contract price would be if the stock moves 5% up in 60 days
+10% stock move in 60 days- the value displayed should be what the contract price would be if the stock moves 10% up in 60 days
+20% stock move in 60 days- the value displayed should be what the contract price would be if the stock moves 20% up in 60 days
-5% stock move in 60 days- the value displayed should be what the contract price would be if the stock moves -5% up in 60 days
-10% stock move in 60 days- the value displayed should be what the contract price would be if the stock moves -10% up in 60 days
-20% stock move in 60 days- the value displayed should be what the contract price would be if the stock moves -20% up in 60 days

the forecasting columns i have a formula in the python file attached on how these can be calculated once two data points can be found, the two that are missing are:
 risk free rate- US treasury yield security matching the same time frame as the contract expiration date
 implied volatility-  each contract has an implied volatility




screening questions
the following data points have been difficult for me to find, do you know of an api or paid data feed on how to acquire these data points:
diluted eps current year, diluted eps next year, implied volatility, risk free rate, eps trend table, historical pe, historical earnings?
