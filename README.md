# shadowstocks

code that is active can be found in the Version 1 file
in there there is a readme.txt file that explains some of the output and inputs of the functions creating the tables

3tables_base.ipynb is the file that runs the functions from the other files and can be used for personal analysis

we are currently using eodhd.com as the data source through their api


other interesting apis that we came across are:
polygon.io (has live options data)
financial modeling prep
alphavantage
